# LessUselessContent Resourcepack

Got tired of Minecraft's newest updates. Didn't feel like Minecraft.<br>
So I got into making a datapack and I really liked it. This is the resource pack that comes with it.<br>
> Friends helped me, I am a terrible artist.

Added stuff I wanted to add, then realized making existing things less useless was the way to go.<br>
Kinda stopped working on the project cuz I (sadly) lost interest in playing Minecraft.

I'm keeping it in a corner of my mind tho.
